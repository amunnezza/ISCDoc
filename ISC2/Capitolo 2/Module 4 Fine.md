## Module Objective

-   L2.4.1 Practice the terminology of and review Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery and Incident Response Concepts.

This chapter focused mainly on the availability part of the CIA triad and the importance of maintaining availability for business operations. Maintaining business operations during or after an incident, event, breach, intrusion, exploit or zero day is accomplished through the implementation of Incident Response, Business Continuity (BC), and/or Disaster Recovery (DR) plans. While these three plans may seem to overlap in scope, they are three distinct plans that are vital to the survival of any organization facing out of the ordinary operating conditions. Here are the primary things to remember from this chapter:

First, the Incident Response plan responds to abnormal operating conditions to keep the business operating. The four main components of Incident Response are: Preparation; Detection and Analysis; Containment, Eradication and Recovery; and Post-Incident Activity. Incident Response teams are typically a cross-functional group of individuals who represent the management, technical and functional areas of responsibility most directly impacted by a security incident. The team is trained on incident response and the organization’s incident response plan. When an incident occurs, the team is responsible for determining the amount and scope of damage and whether any confidential information was compromised, implementing recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage, and supervising implementation of future measures to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.

Second, the Business Continuity plan is designed to keep the organization operating through the crisis. Components of the Business Continuity plan include details about how and when to enact the plan and notification systems and call trees for alerting the team members and organizational associates that the plan has been enacted. In addition, it includes contact numbers for contacting critical third-party partners, external emergency providers, vendors and customers. The plan provides the team with immediate response procedures and checklists and guidance for management.

Finally, when both the Incident Response and Business Continuity (BC) plans fail, the Disaster Recovery (DR) plan is activated to return operations to normal as quickly as possible. The Disaster Recovery (DR) plan may include the following components: executive summary providing a high-level overview of the plan, department-specific plans, technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems, full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members, and checklists for certain individuals.

**Question 1**
1 / 1 point
You are working in your organization's security office. You receive a call from a user who has tried to log in to the network several times with the correct credentials, with no success. This is an example of a(n)_______. (D2, L2.1.1)
Question options:
A) Emergency
B) Event
c) Policy
D) Disaster
Correct. The user has reported that something measurable has occurred; at this point, we are not sure what it might be (if it is a normal occurrence, or something that poses adverse impact), so the best description is "event."

**Question 2**
1 / 1 point
You are working in your organization's security office. You receive a call from a user who has tried to log in to the network several times with the correct credentials, with no success. After a brief investigation, you determine that the user's account has been compromised. This is an example of a(n)_______. (D2, L2.1.1)

Question options:
A) Risk management
B) Incident detection
C) Malware
d) Disaster

Correct. The user's report and the subsequent identification of the problem constitute incident detection. 

**Question 3**
0 / 1 point
An external entity has tried to gain access to your organization's IT environment without proper authorization. This is an example of a(n) _________. (D2, L2.1.1)
Question options:

A) Exploit
B) Intrusion
c) Event
D) Malware

Incorrect. While this is, in the most general sense, an event (because it is something in the IT environment that can be measured), the term "intrusion" is a much more specific, accurate description of the situation, so B is a better answer.

**Question 4**
1 / 1 point
When responding to a security incident, your team determines that the vulnerability that was exploited was not widely known to the security community, and that there are no currently known definitions/listings in common vulnerability databases or collections. This vulnerability and exploit might be called ______. (D2, L 2.1.1)
Question options:
A) Malware
B) Critical
C) Fractal
D) Zero-day

Correct. A zero-day exploit is an attack using a vulnerability that is not widely known in the industry at the time of discovery. 

**Question 5**
1 / 1 point
True or False? The IT department is responsible for creating the organization's business continuity plan. (D2, L2.2.1) 
Question options:
True
False
Hide question 5 feedback
Correct. Members from across the organization, not just IT, should participate in creating the BCP to ensure that all systems, processes and operations are accounted for in the plan. 

**Question 6**
1 / 1 point
The Business Continuity effort for an organization is a way to ensure critical ______ functions are maintained during a disaster, emergency, or interruption to the production environment. (D2, L 2.2.1) 
Question options:
A) Business
B)Technical
C) IT
D)Financial

Correct. The Business Continuity effort is designed to ensure critical business functions continue during periods of potential interruption.

**Question 7**
1 / 1 point
Which of the following is very likely to be used in a disaster recovery (DR) effort? (D2, L 2.3.1)
Question options:
A) Guard dogs
B) Data backups

Correct. Restoring from backups is often very useful during a DR effort. 

**Question 8**
1 / 1 point
Which of the following is often associated with DR planning? (D2, L 2.3.1)
Question options:
A) Checklists
B) Firewalls
C) Motion detectors
D) Non-repudiation

Correct. Both BC and DR activities typically include checklists for the people participating in the effort. 

**Question 9**
0 / 1 point
Which of these activities is often associated with DR efforts? (D2, L2.3.1)

A) Employees returning to the primary production location
B) Running anti-malware solutions
C) Scanning the IT environment for vulnerabilities
D) Zero-day exploits

Incorrect. Vulnerability scans are a regular part of IT security practices, but not typically associated with DR efforts. 

**Question 10**
1 / 1 point
Which of these components is very likely to be instrumental to any disaster recovery (DR) effort? (D2, L2.3.1)
Question options:
A) Routers
