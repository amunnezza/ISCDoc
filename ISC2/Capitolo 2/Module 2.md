#### Module Objective

-   L2.2.1 Summarize the components of a business continuity plan.

Manny: It's clear that planning is a big part of incident response. You can't just react to a crisis in the moment. You have to be prepared. Tasha: Absolutely. And usually, a business can't afford to just shut down while they figure things out. That's when a business continuity plan comes into play. Manny: Another plan to protect the business and its people? Tasha: That's right. We'll learn more about business continuity planning in this module
# The Importance of Business Continuity

The intent of a business continuity plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption. An event has created a disturbance in the environment, and now you need to know how to maintain the business. 

A key part of the plan is communication, including multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of a disruption of power or communications. Many organizations will establish a phone tree, so that if one person is not available, they know who else to call. Organizations will go through their procedures and checklists to make sure they know exactly who is responsible for which action. No matter how many times they have flown, without fail, pilots go through a checklist before take-off. Similarly, there must be established procedures and a thorough checklist, so that no vital element of business continuity will be missed. 

We call the appropriate individuals and start to activate the business continuity plan. Management must be included, because sometimes priorities may change depending on the situation. Individuals with proper authority must be there to execute operations, for instance, if there are critical areas that need to be shut down. 

We need to have at hand the critical contact numbers for the supply chain, as well as law enforcement and other sites outside of the facility. For example, a hospital may suffer a severe cyberattack that affects communications from the pharmacy, the internet or phone lines. In the United States, in case of this type of cyberattack that knocks out communications, specific numbers in specific networks can bypass the normal cell phone services and use military-grade networks. Those will be assigned to authorized individuals for hospitals or other critical infrastructures in case of a major disruption or cyberattack, so they can still maintain essential activity.
# The Goal of Business Continuity

Narrator: Business continuity refers to enabling the critical aspects of the organization to function, perhaps at a reduced capacity, during a disruption caused by any form of disturbance, attack, infrastructure failure or natural disaster. Most incidents are minor and can be handled easily with minimal impact. A system requires a reboot for example, but after a few minutes the system is back in operation and the incident is over. But once in a while a major incident will interrupt business for an unacceptable length of time, and the organization cannot just follow an incident plan but must move toward business continuity. Business continuity includes planning, preparation, response and recovery operations, but it does not generally include activities to support full restoration of all business activities and services. It focuses on the critical products and services that the organization provides and ensures those important areas can continue to operate even at a reduced level of performance until business returns to normal. Developing a business continuity plan requires a significant organizational commitment in terms of both personnel and financial resources. To gain this commitment, organizational support for business continuity planning efforts must be provided by executive management or an executive sponsor. Without the proper support, business continuity planning efforts have little chance of success.
