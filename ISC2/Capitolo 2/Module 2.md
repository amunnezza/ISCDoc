# Module 2: Understand Business Continuity (BC)

Domain D2.1.1, D2.1.2, D2.1.3

#### Module Objective

-   L2.2.1 Summarize the components of a business continuity plan.

Manny: It's clear that planning is a big part of incident response. You can't just react to a crisis in the moment. You have to be prepared. 
Tasha: Absolutely. And usually, a business can't afford to just shut down while they figure things out. That's when a business continuity plan comes into play.
Manny: Another plan to protect the business and its people? 
Tasha: That's right. We'll learn more about business continuity planning in this module

# The Importance of Business Continuity

The intent of a business continuity plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption. An event has created a disturbance in the environment, and now you need to know how to maintain the business. 

A key part of the plan is communication, including multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of a disruption of power or communications. Many organizations will establish a phone tree, so that if one person is not available, they know who else to call. Organizations will go through their procedures and checklists to make sure they know exactly who is responsible for which action. No matter how many times they have flown, without fail, pilots go through a checklist before take-off. Similarly, there must be established procedures and a thorough checklist, so that no vital element of business continuity will be missed. 

We call the appropriate individuals and start to activate the business continuity plan. Management must be included, because sometimes priorities may change depending on the situation. Individuals with proper authority must be there to execute operations, for instance, if there are critical areas that need to be shut down. 

We need to have at hand the critical contact numbers for the supply chain, as well as law enforcement and other sites outside of the facility. For example, a hospital may suffer a severe cyberattack that affects communications from the pharmacy, the internet or phone lines. In the United States, in case of this type of cyberattack that knocks out communications, specific numbers in specific networks can bypass the normal cell phone services and use military-grade networks. Those will be assigned to authorized individuals for hospitals or other critical infrastructures in case of a major disruption or cyberattack, so they can still maintain essential activity.

# The Goal of Business Continuity
### video GoalBusinessContinuity.mkv

*Narrator:* Business continuity refers to enabling the critical aspects of the organization to function, perhaps at a reduced capacity, during a disruption caused by any form of disturbance, attack, infrastructure failure or natural disaster. Most incidents are minor and can be handled easily with minimal impact. A system requires a reboot for example, but after a few minutes the system is back in operation and the incident is over. But once in a while a major incident will interrupt business for an unacceptable length of time, and the organization cannot just follow an incident plan but must move toward business continuity. Business continuity includes planning, preparation, response and recovery operations, but it does not generally include activities to support full restoration of all business activities and services. It focuses on the critical products and services that the organization provides and ensures those important areas can continue to operate even at a reduced level of performance until business returns to normal. Developing a business continuity plan requires a significant organizational commitment in terms of both personnel and financial resources. To gain this commitment, organizational support for business continuity planning efforts must be provided by executive management or an executive sponsor. Without the proper support, business continuity planning efforts have little chance of success.

# Components of a Business Continuity Plan

Business continuity planning (BCP) is the proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster or other significant disruption to the organization. Members from across the organization should participate in creating the BCP to ensure all systems, processes and operations are accounted for in the plan.

The term business is used often, as this is mostly a business function as opposed to a technical one. However, in order to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, the technology must align with the business needs.

Here are some common components of a comprehensive business continuity plan:

-   List of the BCP team members, including multiple contact methods and backup members
-   Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
-   Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
-   Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers
-   How/when to enact the plan
-   Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)

# Business Continuity in the Workplace

Narrator: Obviously, the business continuity plan needs to be maintained somewhere where it can be accessed. Often, in modern organizations, everything is digital and not provided as a hard copy. This can be dangerous, just like storing everything within the main company building. Some organizations have what is called the Red Book, which is given to the appropriate individual outside the facility. All the procedures are outlined in that document—in case, for example, a hurricane hits, the power is out and all the facilities are compromised and there is no access to electronic backups. It is important to update this hard-copy Red Book any time the electronic copy is updated so both versions remain consistent.

# Common Business Continuity Components

Is the following statement true or false? An important component of the business continuity plan details how and when the plan is enacted. (D2, L2.1.3)

==*True*==
 False

**True**
It's important to include when and how the plan will be used.


# Know Your Business Continuity Plan

How often should an organization test its business continuity plan (BCP)? (D2, L2.2.1) 

 A. Annually

 B. Continually

 C. ==Routinely==

 D. Daily

Check Answer

==Correct answer: C==

The correct answer is C—Routinely. Each individual organization must determine how often to test its BCP, but it should be tested at predefined intervals as well as when significant changes happen within the business environment. Answer A—Annually—is incorrect because it is too specific—not every organization needs to test its BCP every year. Answer B—Continually—is incorrect because it is too vague and does not specify a minimum timeframe for review. Answer D—Daily—is incorrect because testing the BCP daily is too often for most organizations.

# Business Continuity in Action

What does business continuity look like in action?

_Imagine that the billing department of a company suffers a complete loss in a fire. The fire occurred overnight, so no personnel were in the building at the time. A_ 
>[!Business Impact Analysis (BIA)]-
>An analysis of an information system’s requirements, functions, and interdependencies used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption. NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1

_was performed four months ago and identified the functions of the billing department as very important to the company, but not immediately affecting other areas of work. Through a previously signed agreement, the company has an alternative area in which the billing department can work, and it can be available in less than one week. Until that area can be fully ready, customer billing inquiries will be answered by customer service staff. The billing department personnel will remain in the alternate working area until a new permanent area is available._

In this scenario, the BIA already identified the dependencies of customer billing inquiries and revenue. Because the company has ample cash reserves, a week without billing is acceptable during this interruption to normal business. Pre-planning was realized by having an alternate work area ready for the personnel and having the customer service department handle the billing department’s calls during the transition to temporary office space. With the execution of the plan, there was no material interruption to the company’s business or its ability to provide services to its customers—indicating a successful implementation of the business continuity plan.
