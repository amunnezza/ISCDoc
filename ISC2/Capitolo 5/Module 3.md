#### Module Objective

-   L5.3.1 Explain the application of common security policies.

An organization’s security policies define what “security” means to that organization, which in almost all cases reflects the tradeoff between security, operability, affordability and potential risk impacts. Security policies express or impose behavioral or other constraints on the system and its use. Well-designed systems operating within these constraints should reduce the potential of security breaches to an acceptable level.
