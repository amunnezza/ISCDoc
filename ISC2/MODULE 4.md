Manny: There's so much to consider when trying to secure information. Who decides what needs to be protected and how we should go about it? 
Tasha: That kind of oversight can come in a number of different forms. Let's find out more.

# Governance Elements

Any business or organization exists to fulfill a purpose, whether it is to provide raw materials to an industry, manufacture equipment to build computer hardware, develop software applications, construct buildings or provide goods and services. To complete the objective requires that decisions are made, rules and practices are defined, and policies and procedures are in place to guide the organization in its pursuit of achieving its goals and mission.

When leaders and management implement the systems and structures that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures.

How are regulations, standards, policies and procedures related?  It might help to look at the list in reverse.   

-   Procedures are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies.
-   Policies are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations.
-   Standards are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations.
-   Regulations are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for noncompliance.

Now that we see how they are connected, we’ll look at some details and examples of each.

### Regulations and Laws

![image of a scroll representing regulations](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/assets/EDU-ELCC-70060b-techart-regulations-v01.svg?_&d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541 "image of a scroll representing regulations")

Regulations and associated fines and penalties can be imposed by governments at the national, regional or local level. Because regulations and laws can be imposed and enforced differently in different parts of the world, here are a few examples to connect the concepts to actual regulations.

The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_04/ch01-m04-Governance_Elements.html?d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) is an example of a law that governs the use of protected health information (PHI) in the United States. Violation of the HIPAA rule carries the possibility of fines and/or imprisonment for both individuals and companies.

The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_04/ch01-m04-Governance_Elements.html?d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) was enacted by the European Union (EU) to control use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its citizens and those in the EU. It includes provisions that apply financial penalties to companies who handle data of EU citizens and those living in the EU even if the company does not have a physical presence in the EU, giving this regulation an international reach.

Finally, it is common to be subject to regulation on several levels. Multinational organizations are subject to regulations in more than one nation in addition to multiple regions and municipalities. Organizations need to consider the regulations that apply to their business at all levels—national, regional and local—and ensure they are compliant with the most restrictive regulation.

### Standards

![image of clipboard representing standards](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/assets/EDU-ELCC-70060c-techart-standards-v01.svg?_&d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541 "image of clipboard representing standards")

Organizations use multiple standards as part of their information systems security programs, both as compliance documents and as advisories or guidelines. Standards cover a broad range of issues and ideas and may provide assurance that an organization is operating with policies and procedures that support regulations and are widely accepted best practices.

The [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_04/ch01-m04-Governance_Elements.html?d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) develops and publishes international standards on a variety of technical subjects, including information systems and information security, as well as encryption standards. ISO solicits input from the international community of experts to provide input on its standards prior to publishing. Documents outlining ISO standards may be purchased online.

The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_04/ch01-m04-Governance_Elements.html?d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) is a United States government agency under the Department of Commerce and publishes a variety of technical standards in addition to information technology and information security standards. Many of the standards issued by NIST are requirements for U.S. government agencies and are considered recommended standards by industries worldwide. NIST standards solicit and integrate input from industry and are free to download from the NIST website.

Finally, think about how computers talk to other computers across the globe. People speak different languages and do not always understand each other. How are computers able to communicate? Through standards, of course!

Thanks to the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_04/ch01-m04-Governance_Elements.html?d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#), there are standards in communication protocols that ensure all computers can connect with each other across borders, even when the operators do not speak the same language.

The [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_04/ch01-m04-Governance_Elements.html?d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) also sets standards for telecommunications, computer engineering and similar disciplines.



### Policies

![image of official document representing policies](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/assets/EDU-ELCC-70060d-techart-policies-v01.svg?_&d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541 "image of official document representing policies")

Policy is informed by applicable law(s) and specifies which standards and guidelines the organization will follow. Policy is broad, but not detailed; it establishes context and sets out strategic direction and priorities. Governance policies are used to moderate and control decision-making, to ensure compliance when necessary and to guide the creation and implementation of other policies.

Policies are often written at many levels across the organization. High-level governance policies are used by senior executives to shape and control decision-making processes. Other high-level policies direct the behavior and activity of the entire organization as it moves toward specific or general goals and objectives. Functional areas such as human resources management, finance and accounting, and security and asset protection usually have their own sets of policies. Whether imposed by laws and regulations or by contracts, the need for compliance might also require the development of specific high-level policies that are documented and assessed for their effective use by the organization.

Policies are implemented, or carried out, by people; for that, someone must expand the policies from statements of intent and direction into step-by-step instructions, or procedures.


### Procedures

![image of clipboard and cog wheel representing procedures](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/assets/EDU-ELC-70060e-techart-procedures-v01.svg?_&d2lSessionVal=YNLp1lk5mWLGMCBIBeCFccQJ3&ou=9541 "image of clipboard and cog wheel representing procedures")

Procedures define the explicit, repeatable activities necessary to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks. They provide supporting data, decision criteria or other explicit knowledge needed to perform each task. Procedures can address one-time or infrequent actions or common, regular occurrences. In addition, procedures establish the measurement criteria and methods to use to determine whether a task has been successfully completed. Properly documenting procedures and training personnel on how to locate and follow them is necessary for deriving the maximum organizational benefits from procedures.


# Importance of Governance Elements
Narrator: Regulations and laws can affect the day-to-day operations of many organizations. As we mentioned before, one example of a law with a broad impact is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which affords data protection and control to individuals within the territorial boundaries of the EU regardless of citizenship. As another example, in the United States, patient medical information is governed by the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and must be closely guarded. From the information security perspective, a high standard of professionalism is expected in safeguarding data on the patients’ behalf. Information security is based on trust and credibility. If something goes wrong, the stakeholders’ trust evaporates, and organizations’ credibility is damaged—sometimes without cure. HIPAA also carries significant criminal and financial penalties for noncompliance for both the organization and the individuals involved. Fortunately, there are published frameworks, or standards, to guide the organizational policies that support the compliance effort. Many departments or workgroups within the organization implement procedures that detail how they complete day-to-day tasks while remaining compliant. Among these groups is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO is an international standards body; one of the standards that ISO publishes is how to destroy data in a secure fashion.
