_Manny_: One of the biggest issues in cybersecurity is that computers are all linked together, sometimes by physical networks within a building, and almost always via the Internet, so it's easy for viruses and other threats to move rapidly through networks. 
_Tasha_: That's right, and cyber threats and attacks are getting more sophisticated all the time. This aspect of cybersecurity is always evolving. Let's find out more.

# What is Networking

A network is simply two or more computers linked together to share data, information or resources.

To properly establish secure data communications, it is important to explore all of the technologies involved in computer communications. From [hardware](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_04/module_01/ch04_m01-What_is_Networking.html?d2lSessionVal=Mi4hLS4lYYLy6kUwwSCV3JUf6&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) and [software](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_04/module_01/ch04_m01-What_is_Networking.html?d2lSessionVal=Mi4hLS4lYYLy6kUwwSCV3JUf6&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) to [protocols](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_04/module_01/ch04_m01-What_is_Networking.html?d2lSessionVal=Mi4hLS4lYYLy6kUwwSCV3JUf6&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) and [encryption](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_04/module_01/ch04_m01-What_is_Networking.html?d2lSessionVal=Mi4hLS4lYYLy6kUwwSCV3JUf6&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) and beyond, there are many details, standards and procedures to be familiar with.

## Types of Networks

There are two basic types of networks:

-   **Local area network (LAN)** - A local area network (LAN) is a network typically spanning a single floor or building. This is commonly a limited geographical area.
-   **Wide area network (WAN**) - Wide area network (WAN) is the term usually assigned to the long-distance connections between geographically remote networks.
