TRANSCRIPT
Manny: Hello, my name is Manny, and welcome to (ISC)2 and the world of cybersecurity. We are so glad you're here. As a guidance counselor at the local high school, I work with young people making choices about their futures. I talk to them about career opportunities in cybersecurity. The demand for cybersecurity professionals is high right now. Did you know cybersecurity jobs are growing at an unprecedented rate, and are expected to keep growing? Tasha: And the need is just as pressing in countries around the globe. Congratulations on taking this step toward a dynamic and rewarding career as a cybersecurity professional. My name is Tasha, and I'm a professor at the local university. Manny and I will be your guides through this course. Manny: Let's get started with this first chapter, where you’ll learn about the security principles, concepts of information assurance, and the risk management process. You'll also explore the safeguards and countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network and its information. Tasha: Next, you'll be introduced to organizational security roles and governance. And finally, we'll cover the (ISC)2 code of ethics, which all members of (ISC)2 commit to. Manny: But first, we'll introduce you to JavaSip, our favorite coffee shop. Tasha: Sandra owns and operates the coffee shop, and it's a family affair. Nate is the manager, and her son Keith works there as well. Manny: We're not the only regular customers. Susan comes in every day. She's also a member of (ISC)2 and is a System Security Certified Practitioner. Tasha: SSCP for short. Susan works in a security operations center for a nearby financial services company. Manny: Finally, Gabriela is a friend of Keith's. She's in her first year at the local university and was recently hired as a barista. Tasha: Unfortunately, Keith isn't too keen about working for his mom at the coffee shop, and he wants to find something more meaningful that will help others and make a difference. We'll follow Keith's story as he figures out what he wants to do.

# Keith's Story
TRANSCRIPT
Manny: It's time to check in with our friends at JavaSip. Tasha: Keith has finished his university studies but doesn't know what to do next. He's working at JavaSip because it's convenient. His mother, Sandra, owns the place. Manny: But this is not his dream job. Unfortunately, he has no idea what his dream job may be. Tasha: Let's see what he's thinking about his future. Sandra: I don't know why you're not happy here. This is a great job. It's flexible, you get to meet some interesting people. You get to work with your wonderful mother all day. Keith: Ah, yes, aren't I lucky? Sandra: Someday this could be all yours and Nate's. Keith: Yeah, Nate loves business, and he loves it here. But Mom, I want to do something different. I don't know what it is, but I'll figure it out. Sandra: I know you will, Keith. You are an intelligent young man. In the meantime, I am happy to have you working with us. Keith: Thanks, Mom. Manny: I remember those years. It's hard to know what you want to do when you're young. Tasha: Sometimes it's hard to know what you want when you're older, too. Manny: That's true. If only we could help Keith discover a rewarding career that would suit him. Tasha: Indeed.
