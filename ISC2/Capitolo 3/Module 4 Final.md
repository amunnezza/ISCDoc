# Module 4: Chapter 3 Summary

Domain D3.1, D3.1.1, D3.1.2, D3.1.3, D3.2, D3.2.1, D3.2.2, D3.2.3, D3.2.4, D3.2.5

## Module Objective

-   L3.4.1 Practice the terminology of and review concepts of access controls.

In this chapter, we described who gets access to what, why access is necessary, and how that access is managed. Access is based on three elements: subjects (who), objects (what), and rules (how and when). Trustworthiness and the need for access also determine access. 

We also discussed defense in depth (an information security strategy integrating people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization) and how it applies to the types of access control (physical, logical/technical, and administrative) that every information security professional should be familiar with. At the same time, we stressed the importance of the Principle of Least Privilege (users should only have the minimum access necessary to accomplish their job).  

We then discussed Privileged Access Management and how it relates to risk and the CIA Triad: it reduces risk by allowing admin privileges to be used only when needed, provides confidentiality by limiting the need for administrative access that is used during routine business, ensures integrity by only allowing authorized administrative access during approved activities, and confirms availability by providing administrative access when needed. We also differentiated between a Regular User Account and a Privileged User Account.

We further discussed segregation of duties, two-person integrity, and how users are provisioned, from being hired to being terminated. We then explored physical and logical access controls and how they are combined to strengthen the overall security of an organization. Physical access controls include security guards, fences, motion detectors, locked doors/gates, sealed windows, lights, cable protection, laptop locks, badges, swipe cards, guard dogs, cameras, mantraps/turnstiles and alarms. Logical access controls (also called technical controls) can be configuration settings or parameters stored as data, managed through a software graphical user interface (GUI), or they can be hardware settings done with switches, jumper plugs or other means.  

We concluded the chapter discussing three logical access controls: DAC, MAC, and RBAC. Discretionary access control (DAC) is a specific type of access control policy that is enforced over all subjects and objects in an information system. A mandatory access control (MAC) policy is one that is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of an information system. Role-based access control (RBAC), as the name suggests, sets up user permissions based on roles.

Which of the following is a subject? (D 3, L3.1.1)

Question options:
A) A file
B) A fence
C) A filename

**Question 2**
1 / 1 point

Lia works in the security office. During research, Lia learns that a configuration change could better protect the organization's IT environment. Lia makes a proposal for this change, but the change cannot be implemented until it is approved, tested, and then cleared for deployment by the Change Control Board. This is an example of __________. (D3, L3.1.1)

Question options:
A) Defense in depth
B) Holistic security
C) Threat intelligence
D) Segregation of duties

Correct. Lia can make a recommendation for a change to the IT environment, but cannot enact the change without participation from another entity in the organization.  

**Question 3**
1 / 1 point
Duncan and Mira both work in the data center at Triffid, Inc. There is a policy in place that requires both of them to be present in the data center at the same time; if one of them has to leave for any reason, the other has to step out, too, until they can both re-enter. This is called ________. (D 3, L3.1.1)
Question options:

A) Blockade
B) Multifactor authentication
C) Two-person integrity
D) Defense in depth

Correct. This policy ensures a single person is not alone with extremely sensitive assets, and reduces the potential for inappropriate activity. 

**Question 4**
1 / 1 point

Clyde is the security analyst tasked with finding an appropriate physical control to reduce the possibility that unbadged people will follow badged employees through the entrance of the organization's facility. Which of the following can address this risk? (D3, L3.2.1)  

Question options:
A) Fences
B) Dogs
C) Bollards
D) Turnstiles

Correct. Turnstiles reduce the possibility of unauthorized personnel following behind authorized personnel, known as "tailgating" or "piggybacking." 

**Question 5**
0 / 1 point

Sinka is considering a physical deterrent control to dissuade unauthorized people from entering the organization's property. Which of the following would serve this purpose? (D3, L3.2.1)
Question options:

A) A wall
B) Razor tape
C) A sign
D) A hidden camera

Incorrect. There is not enough information to make this determination. If the sign says,     "Private-- stay out," it won't serve as an effective deterrent. If the sign says, "Danger--     attack dogs on property," that is an effective deterrent.

**Question 6**
1 / 1 point
Which of these combinations of physical security controls share a single point of failure? (D3, L3.2.1)
Question options:
A) Guards and fences
B) Badge readers and walls
C) Dogs and bollards
D) High-illumination lighting and cameras

Correct. Both lighting and cameras require power; a power failure will disable both the cameras and the lights.  

**Question 7**
1 / 1 point

Question options:

A) Confidential
B) Complex
C) Unique
D) Long

Correct. Identity assertions must be unique, to differentiate between various users.

**Question 8**
1 / 1 point
Lakshmi presents a userid and a password to a system in order to log on. Which of the following characteristics must the _**password**_ have? (D3, L3.3.1) 

Question options:
A) Confidential
B) Unique
C) Mathematical
D) Shared

Correct. Passwords, like all authenticating elements, must be kept secret, and known only to the user.

**Question 9**
1 / 1 point
Derrick logs on to a system in order to read a file. In this example, Derrick is the ______. (D3, L3.3.1)
Question options:

A) Subject
B) Object
C) Process
D) Predicate

Correct. Subjects are entities that access objects.  

**Question 10**
1 / 1 point
Which is a physical control that prevents "piggybacking" or "tailgating"; that is, an unauthorized person following an authorized person into a controlled area? (D3, L3.2.1)

Question options:
A) Bollard
B) Turnstile
C) Fence
D) Wall

Correct. A turnstile typically uses a revolving mechanism which only allows one person to be admitted at a time, reducing the possibility of an unauthorized person following an authorized person into a controlled area.
