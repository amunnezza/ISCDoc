_Manny_: It's pretty easy to picture physical controls, and we've all used passwords and other kinds of access controls, but what are logical access controls? 
_Tasha_: This gets a little more technical. The parameters that are set up within a system can affect who has access to certain information and what they can do with it. For example, a system could be configured so that anyone who has permission to edit a file also has permission to copy it and share it with someone else. 
_Manny_: We'll learn more in this module about different types of logical controls.
