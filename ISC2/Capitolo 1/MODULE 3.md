# Module 3: Understand Security Controls

Domain D1.3.1, D1.3.2, D1.3.3

## Module Objective

-   L1.3.1 Classify types of security controls.


<font color=red>*Manny*</font> When I think about cybersecurity professionals and all the data and systems that they are charged with protecting, it makes me wonder what kind of safeguards could possibly be put in place to carry out this task. 
<FONT COLOR  =RED>Tasha </FONT>: These safeguards are called controls, and they take several forms from securing the physical locations of server rooms to implementing technical controls to keep bad actors out of the network, and even writing policies so employees and coworkers can do their part. We'll learn more about security controls in this module.

# What are Security Controls?

>[!Security controls]-
>The management, operational and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and its information. Source: FIPS PUB 199

pertain to the physical, technical and administrative mechanisms that act as safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and its information. The implementation of controls should reduce risk, hopefully to an acceptable level.

## Physical Controls

>[!Physical controls]- 
>Controls implemented through a tangible mechanism. Examples include walls, fences, guards, locks, etc. In modern organizations, many physical control systems are linked to technical/logical systems, such as badge readers connected to door locks.

address process-based security needs using physical hardware devices, such as badge readers, architectural features of buildings and facilities, and specific security actions to be taken by people. They typically provide ways of controlling, directing or preventing the movement of people and equipment throughout a specific physical location, such as an office suite, factory or other facility. Physical controls also provide protection and control over entry onto the land surrounding the buildings, parking lots or other areas that are within the organization’s control. In most situations, physical controls are supported by technical controls as a means of incorporating them into an overall security system.

Visitors and guests accessing a workplace, for example, must often enter the facility through a designated entrance and exit, where they can be identified, their visit’s purpose assessed, and then allowed or denied entry. Employees would enter, perhaps through other entrances, using company-issued badges or other tokens to assert their identity and gain access. These require technical controls to integrate the badge or token readers, the door release mechanisms and the identity management and access control systems into a more seamless security system.
## Technical Controls

>[!Technical controls]-
>Security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an information system that are primarily implemented and executed by the information system through mechanisms contained in the hardware, software or firmware components of the system.

(also called logical controls) are security controls that computer systems and networks directly implement. These controls can provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate detection of security violations and support security requirements for applications and data. Technical controls can be configuration settings or parameters stored as data, managed through a software graphical user interface (GUI), or they can be hardware settings done with switches, jumper plugs or other means. However, the implementation of technical controls always requires significant operational considerations and should be consistent with the management of security within the organization. Many of these will be examined in more depth as we look at them in later sections in this chapter and in subsequent chapters.

## Administrative Controls

>[!Administrative controls]- 
>Controls implemented through policy and procedures. Examples include access control processes and requiring multiple personnel to conduct a specific operation. Administrative controls in modern environments are often enforced in conjunction with physical and/or technical controls, such as an access-granting policy for new users that requires login and approval by the hiring manager.

(also known as managerial controls) are directives, guidelines or advisories aimed at the people within the organization. They provide frameworks, constraints and standards for human behavior, and should cover the entire scope of the organization’s activities and its interactions with external parties and stakeholders.

It is vitally important to realize that administrative controls can and should be powerful, effective tools for achieving information security. Even the simplest security awareness policies can be an effective control, if you can help the organization fully implement them through systematic training and practice.

Many organizations are improving their overall security posture by integrating their administrative controls into the task-level activities and operational decision processes that their workforce uses throughout the day. This can be done by providing them as in-context ready reference and advisory resources, or by linking them directly into training activities. These and other techniques bring the policies to a more neutral level and away from the decision-making of only the senior executives. It also makes them immediate, useful and operational on a daily and per-task basis.

Narrator: What sorts of activities can threaten the elements of the CIA Triad? Consider a coworker sharing passwords. Perhaps Joe gives Joanne his password because he is home sick and needs Joanne to sign on to his work computer to get information he needs. But later, Joanne is fired from her job. The employer cancels Joanne’s credentials but isn’t aware that Joanne also knows Joe’s password. Joanne is disgruntled and decides to take revenge on her old company by using Joe’s credentials to change or delete important files. Or in less hostile circumstances, improper use of the password could accidentally result in the introduction of unauthorized software that is riddled with malware. Another example is the laptop of a remote worker being left unattended or unlocked in the worker’s home. Children or other family members may decide to play games on the computer. They upload legal but contaminated software or files, leading to a corrupt workstation with compromised integrity. The elements of the CIA Triad can also be compromised by ill-preparedness against acts of nature. For instance, a long-term power outage may lead to backup generators that run out of fuel or that suffer mechanical failures if not properly maintained. As a final example, improper fire suppression methods can affect the CIA Triad by irreparably damaging or destroying both digital and analog information. All these examples show that a comprehensive risk assessment of technical, human and environmental threats must be completed, then appropriate mitigation options must be put in place to protect the security and integrity of an organization’s information.
