Domain D1.4.1

## Module Objective

-   L1.5.1 Analyze appropriate outcomes according to the canons of the (ISC)2  Code of Ethics when given examples.
- Manny: We've made it to the last module of our first chapter. Tasha: That's right. And we've learned that cybersecurity professionals have a lot of responsibility when it comes to protecting information systems and the data that is stored and used on them. Manny: Yes, we put a lot of trust in them that they will do the right thing. I'd feel more comfortable knowing that they must take some kind of oath or something, so we could rest assured they’re acting in the best interest of their organizations and the public. Tasha: I agree, Manny. Ethical guidelines are extremely important. It gives the profession credibility. And you know what? Manny: What? Tasha: All members of (ISC)2 commit to adhere to its code of ethics. Manny: That makes me feel better. Let’s find out more about it.

# Theoretical Example: Code of Ethics

Narrator: Here is an example of an ethical question that might come up for cyber security professionals. An organization handling Top Secret and other sensitive information was hiring new employees. At its facility, it used a retinal scanner to grant access to high-security areas, including where prospective employees were interviewed. Retinal scanners, unbeknownst to most people, can not only match blood vessels on an individual’s retina, but they can also tell the difference between males and females. Further, they can tell whether a female is pregnant. The organization used this information gathered by its access control system to discriminate against female candidates for the positions it was seeking to fill. Allowing this data to be accessed by those making hiring decisions was indisputably in violation of the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics, which states that information security professionals must act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally. Here is another example: The security manager for an organization heard from a network administrator who reported another user for violating the organization’s acceptable use policy. When the security manager investigated the matter, he discovered several pertinent facts: • The user did violate the policy. • The violation was not a criminal matter. • The network administrator had the IT permissions to monitor the user. • The network administrator was not tasked with monitoring the user, nor was the administrator tasked with randomly monitoring all users. • The network administrator would not say how the administrator came to learn that the user was violating policy. • In talking with colleagues of both people, it became clear that there was a personal conflict between the administrator and the user. In many jurisdictions, the organization can use any information, regardless of source, to make labor decisions. So yes, the organization could use this information against the user. The user violated the policy but did not break the law. Depending on how egregious the infraction was, the organization may choose to punish the user for the violation. Because the administrator would not explain why he was monitoring the user, it makes his actions suspect at best, and nefarious at worst. The administrator violated the trust given to him by the organization; as an IT professional, the administrator was expected to use authority and permissions in an adult and objective manner. This situation is almost certainly an example of the administrator using authority to settle a personal grievance. The administrator should be punished much more severely than the user (firing the administrator is not untoward; this person may have opened the organization up to a lawsuit for creating a hostile work environment, which may have an impact/risk that exceeds whatever policy violation the user committed). Whether the administrator was terminated or not, his actions were in clear contradiction of the Code of Ethics.


# Applying the Code

True or False? All (ISC)2 members commit to uphold and adhere to the Code of Ethics Canons. (D1, L1.5.1)

 True
# What is the Appropriate Action?

Cranz is an (ISC)² member and an employee of Triffid Corporation. One of Cranz’s colleagues offers to share a file that contains an illicit copy of a newly released movie. What should Cranz do? (D1, L1.5.1)

 A. Inform (ISC)²

Incorrect. The (ISC)² Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” The Code, however, does not require that members report violations to (ISC)².

 B. Accept the movie

Incorrect. The (ISC)² Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” Accepting or participating in the distribution of intellectual property owned by someone else would be counter to this Canon, and it would also go against the Canon requiring that (ISC)² members “advance and protect the profession.”

 C. Refuse to accept

Correct. The (ISC)² Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” Refusing to accept or participate in the distribution of intellectual property owned by someone else would be counter to this Canon, and it would also go against the Canon requiring that (ISC)² members “advance and protect the profession.”

 D. Inform law enforcement

Incorrect. The (ISC)² Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” The Code, however, does not require that members act as law enforcement agents, so Cranz is not required to report the matter to law enforcement, or to (ISC)².
